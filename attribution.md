## Philipp Oppermann's Writing an OS in Rust tutorials

Some assembly code snippets were taken from Philipp Oppermann's very useful blog series on making an x86_64 OS in Rust. I have made changes to some of them.

### Files containing the code snippets

- `src/arch/x86_64/grub.cfg`
- `src/arch/x86_64/kernel.ld`
- `src/arch/x86_64/error.s`
- `src/arch/x86_64/loader.s`
- `src/arch/x86_64/long_mode.s`
- `src/arch/x86_64/multiboot_header.s`
